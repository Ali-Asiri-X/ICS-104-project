# ICS-104-project
The final project for Introduction to Programming Using Python and C course in KFUPM. It has been developed by Ali Asiri and Ziyad Alsufyani.

Note: Because this code had been written while we were an inexperinced freshmen year students, the code varbose and hard to maintain.
We will try to fix that soon.
